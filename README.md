# Learning Resources
An initiaitve by GDG Ahmedabad, for community and by community!

We at GDG Ahmedabad are getting different queries (like I want to learn android development, where to start?, I want to integrate App Engine, how can start with it?) from our community members, so here we want to prepare a repository with all the useful resources/materials for every technologies that there are in market. 

You can call this repository as "Technology Gold mine" :)
